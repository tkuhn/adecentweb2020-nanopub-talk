Decentralized Semantic Publishing with Nanopublications

Nanopublications have been proposed as a format to publish small semantic snippets of scientific results in a provenance-aware manner, but they can also be seen as a general Linked Data container format. I will show in this talk how nanopublications can be combined with cryptographic techniques to enable general-purpose decentralized publishing and querying of machine-interpretable knowledge.

I will demonstrate the existing server network spanning multiple countries that is already fully functional and can be used to publish and reliably retrieve nanopublications. I will futhermore show how larger datasets can be defined and introduce a new decentralized query API that is built on top of the existing server network. To conclude I will argue how these components can be combined to allow for a kind of decentralization that is strong yet realistic and pragmatic.
